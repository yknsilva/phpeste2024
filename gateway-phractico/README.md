# [Usage](#usage)

**_phractico_** was designed with your precious resource in mind: _time!_ âŒš

The **_phractico_** ideology involves fewer configuration files to get your PHP API working.
The [Bootstrap file](./src/Core/Bootstrap.php) concentrates the entire application configuration
for _controllers_, _routing_, etc.

To introduce new endpoints in your API, you simply need to create a _controller_ class by
implementing the [`Controller`](./src/Core/Infrastructure/Http/Controller.php) interface and its `routes` method.
Then, describe routing resources to their actions. Finally,
map the new controller in [ApplicationControllerProvider.php](src/API/Http/Provider/ApplicationControllerProvider.php).

_VoilÃ !_ ðŸŽ‰

For examples, see [ExampleController](./src/API/Http/Controller/ExampleController.php).

# [Database](#database)

Your database connection must be mapped inside [ApplicationDatabaseProvider.php](./src/Database/ApplicationDatabaseProvider.php) class,
which is consumed by bootstrap file when application is initialized.

By default, **_phractico_** comes with a [SQLite database adapter](./src/Database/Connection/SQLiteAdapter.php)
assuming database file is located at path `/path/to/phractico/database/database.sqlite`.

If you want to have others adapters, you just need to implement [Connection](./src/Core/Infrastructure/Database/Connection.php)
and then mapping your new adapter in `ApplicationDatabaseProvider` file.

# [Container DI](#container-di)

**_phractico_** uses a dependency container to manage dependencies throughout the application.
The container and its corresponding dependency mapping are declared in [ApplicationContainer](./src/DI/ApplicationContainer.php).
During the application's runtime, the dependency container is injected into the application instance
and then used in application bootstrap phase.

While **_phractico_** includes a [simple container](./src/Core/Infrastructure/DI/Container.php), it is designed
to support any other dependency injection container that implements the [PSR-11](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-11/),
such as [PHP-DI](https://php-di.org/).

# [Installation](#installation)

Go fast with **_phractico_** and [phpctl](https://github.com/opencodeco/phpctl):

- Run `composer`
```shell
phpctl composer install
```

- Run a local server
```shell
phpctl server 8000 public/
```

- Perform an HTTP request to ensure everything works fine!
```shell
curl -X GET 'http://localhost:8000/example'
```

- Perform an HTTP request to ensure database connection works fine!
  - **Note:** `sqlite3` PHP extension is required for `SQLiteAdapter`
```shell
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:8000/exampleDatabase' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "test": "database"
}'
```

# [Tests and Quality Tools](#tests-and-quality-tools)

To execute all PHPUnit test suites, run:
```shell
phpctl composer test
```

To execute quality tools, run:
```shell
phpctl composer quality
```
